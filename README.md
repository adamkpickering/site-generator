# site-generator

This is a very simple static site generator using file hierarchies for structure
and markdown for content.

## To Do

- distinguish directories and files in generated links (perhaps put a slash after dir names?)
- generate a site map (I'm thinking it should look similar to the output of `tree`)
- use the python markdown module rather than calling markdown with subprocess module
